# Team Ares Project Proposal

## Project Title: **Serpent Sweeper**

### Team Leader: Patrick Arevalo (john_patrick_j_arevalo@dlsu.edu.ph)

### Theme: Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

### Description:
Introducing "Serpent Sweeper," an engaging Java-based 2D game that combines the addictive mechanics of the classic "Snake Game" with an eco-conscious twist, aligning with the inspiring theme of 'Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities'.

In Serpent Sweeper, players embark on a thrilling adventure focused on cleanliness and environmental responsibility. Initially assuming the role of a humble baby serpent, players progressively evolve into a medium-sized serpent and ultimately transform into a formidable super serpent.

To advance through the stages and become the city's heroic savior, players must consume various types of environmental debris, representing their unwavering commitment to cleaning up the surroundings. Starting with "Litters," the baby snake must gather a specified amount to level up into a medium-sized snake. This progression grants them the ability to devour "Trash Heaps," perpetuating the cycle until they attain the coveted status of a super snake and gain the power to consume "Waste Mountain."

The game features three captivating stages: Garden, Park, and City. As players ascend through the stages, they unlock increasingly expansive maps, mirroring the growth of their snake avatar. However, they must navigate carefully amidst the obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Encountering these obstacles, regardless of the snake's size, leads to an immediate game over, challenging players to demonstrate both agility and strategic thinking.

Get ready to immerse yourself in the exciting world of Serpent Sweeper and help your snake hero evolve into a powerful force for environmental cleanliness across the stages, all while avoiding perilous obstacles that stand in your way.
